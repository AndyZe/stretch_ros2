1. Install a partition with Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop Edition
    1. Download and write the [Ubuntu 20.04 iso file](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/ubuntu-20.04.2.0-desktop-amd64.iso) to a USB key.

    3. Boot the robot with the USB key plugged into a USB port in the robot’s trunk. 
    4. The installer should detect your Ubuntu 18.04 installation and provide the option to install Ubuntu 20.04 alongside Ubuntu 18.04. This option will be selected by default. ![20.04 alongside 18.04](./images/ubuntu_installation_1.jpg){:height="200px" width="400px"}
